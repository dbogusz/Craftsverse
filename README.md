# Craftsverse: Etsy Cosplay Listings Analysis

Craftsverse is a comprehensive data analysis project focusing on Etsy listings in the cosplay niche. Using the Etsy API, I collected a dataset of 350k entries, which included details such as prices, views, favorites, reviews, and shop performance. The primary goal was to identify market segments with high profit potential.

- **Clustering Analysis**
  - Categorised listings into segments such as "Affordable Common Listings" and "Luxury Niche Listings."
  - Identified clusters with the highest profit potential.
